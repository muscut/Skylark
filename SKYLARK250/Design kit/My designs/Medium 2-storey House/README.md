# Medium two-storey house prototype 
This is a prototype of a medium-sized two-storey house based on the Skylark system made with blocks released by Open Systems Labs. For a basic house, you will need to have at least one `SKYLARK250_COMB-A/MID-1_detailed` on either side of your Y-axis, this house was extended by one `SKYLARK250_COMB-A/MID-1_detailed` on both sides, which makes it longer.

## Limitations
- This prototype does not have any stairs which makes it unsuitable for actual construction.
- `SKYLARK250_COMB-G/END-Y2_detailed` was fixed manually because the joint did not fit into `SKYLARK250_VERGE-G_detailed` correctly due to being too short.
- `SKYLARK250_COMB-B/END-X3_detailed` was fixed manually because the joint did not align with it's siblings.
- `SKYLARK250_TIE` is having an issue with the inside dimension on SketchUp model is 35.5mm whereas in DXF file it is 36mm. When zooming into this component, you will notice that it does not fully fit. I left this unchanged.
- `SKYLARK250_PEG` is having the same issue as was mentioned for `SKYLARK250_TIE`

Adjustments made: 
- Increased the joint height of `SKYLARK250_COMB-G/END-Y2_detailed` from 255mm to 285mm (matches other combs)
- Increased the joint height of `SKYLARK250_COMB-B/END-X3_detailed` from 268mm to 298mm (matches other combs)
