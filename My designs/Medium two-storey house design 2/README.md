# Medium two-storey house design 2
This is a design of a medium-sized two-storey house based on the Skylark system made with blocks released by Open Systems Labs. For a basic house, you will need to have at least one `SKYLARK250_COMB-A/MID-1_detailed` on either side of your Y-axis, this house was extended by one `SKYLARK250_COMB-A/MID-1_detailed` on both sides, which makes it longer.

## Limitations
- This design does not have any stairs which makes it unsuitable for actual construction.
- `SKYLARK250_COMB-G/END-Y2_detailed` was fixed manually because the joint did not fit into `SKYLARK250_VERGE-G_detailed` correctly due to being too short.
- `SKYLARK250_COMB-B/END-X3_detailed` was fixed manually because the joint did not align with it's siblings.
- `SKYLARK250_TIE` has an issue with the inside dimensions, on the SketchUp model it is 35.5mm whereas in DXF file it is 36mm. When zooming into this component, you will notice that it does not fully fit. This was left unchanged.
- `SKYLARK250_PEG` has the same issue as was mentioned for `SKYLARK250_TIE`
- No blocks available yet to add windows on the front- and back-side of the upper floor.

Adjustments made:
- Increased the joint height of `SKYLARK250_COMB-G/END-Y2_detailed` from 255mm to 285mm (matches other combs)
- Increased the joint height of `SKYLARK250_COMB-B/END-X3_detailed` from 268mm to 298mm (matches other combs)
